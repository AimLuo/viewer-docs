**Mol\* Cheat Sheet**  
一些操作技巧

#### **To Navigate the 3D Canvas:**

**_Rotate_** - Press the left mouse button and move, or use the Shift button + left mouse button and drag.

**_Translate_** - Press the right mouse button and move, or use the Control button + the left mouse button and move. On a touchscreen device, use a two-finger drag.

**_Zoom_** - Use the mouse wheel. On a touchpad, use a two-finger drag. On a touchscreen device, pinch two fingers.

**_Center and zoom_** - Use the right mouse button to click onto the part of the structure you wish to see.

**_Change clipping planes_** - Use the Shift button + the mouse wheel. On a touchpad, use the Shift button + a two-finger drag.

#### **To Select**

First open Selection Mode and change the Picking Level (if needed):

- Click on objects in the 3D canvas, OR
- Click on residues in the Sequence Panel, OR
- Use the Set Operations Menu in the Selection Mode toolbar

#### **To See or Hide**

- Create a component of the region you wish to see/hide →
- Go to the Components Panel and press the “eye” icon next to the component you created

#### **To Color**

**_N-terminus to C-terminus (rainbow)_** - Components → Polymer → Set Coloring → Residue Property → Sequence Id

**_Heteroatom_** - Components → Polymer → Set Coloring → Atom Property → Element Symbol

**_Secondary structure_** - Components → Polymer → Set Coloring → Residue Property → Secondary Structure

**_Hydrophobicity_** - Components → Polymer → Set Coloring → Residue Property → Hydrophobicity

**_Domain_** - Select domain → Selections Menu → Apply Theme to Selection → Color → Apply Theme

#### **To Compare Structures**

First upload two or more structures at rcsb.org/3D-view

**_By chains_** - Select 2 or more polymer chains/residues → Superposition → By Chains → Superpose

**_By atoms_** - Select 1 or more atoms → Superposition → By Atoms→ Superpose

#### **To Make Measurements**

**_Distance_** - Make 2 or more selections → Measurements → Add → Distance (for first 2 selections)

**_Angle_** - Make 3 or more selections → Measurements → Add → Angle (for first 3 selections)

**_Dihedral_** - Make 4 or more selections → Measurements → Add → Dihedral (for first 4 selections)
